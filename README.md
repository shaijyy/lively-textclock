# lively-textclock
A customizable Text-based time indicator. (a.k.a. A qlocktwo clone)

Features:
- Togglable AM/PM indicator
- Ability to only show flat hours
- Change Background Color
- Change Clock Size
- Always display the word "O'Clock"

I plan to add much more customization,
such as more fonts, more color options - maybe even image backgrounds.
